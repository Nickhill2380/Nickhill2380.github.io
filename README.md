# Personal Portfolio


## Description

This Portfolio will serve as a living website, which I will use as a tool to give people a way to have quick access to a lot of my more recent projects. It also contains links to my linked, github, and a way to email me personally. There is a picture of me and of my work space. I used html and css to lay the ground work for this website. I will add more elements and things as I continue to learn. 

    The about me section contains a picture of me and a few sentences about me, along with some lorem generated words. I will update to a more professional picture at some point and complete a better paragraph of my professional and personal background as well as more of the skils I learn from my bootcamp.

    The current projects section contains pictures and links to my most recent projects. I had originally tried to set it up as a css grid but was having problems so I switched it to a flexbox system. Upon further research I believe I can improve this section with the use of css grid areas to get the results I want.

# Credits

The website was designed by me with a few inputs from my wife. She suggested taking out the hover effect that was in one of the earlier drafts of the current project section. I will probably utilize her style and opinion on many more elements of this project and other projects going forward.
