# React Portfolio

## Description

This Portfolio will serve as a living website, which I will use as a tool to give people a way to have quick access to a lot of my more recent projects. It also contains links to my linked, github, and stackoverflow. There is a picture of me and of my work space. I used react to lay the ground work for this website. I will add more elements and things as I continue to learn. 

## Usage
Below is a screenshot of the website, https://nickhill2380.github.io/react-portfolio/

# Credits

The website was designed by me with a few inputs from my wife. I will probably utilize her style and opinion on many more elements of this project and other projects going forward.
